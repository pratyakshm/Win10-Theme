# Windows 10 - Theme Changer

## Description  
These are a simple set of scripts written in PowerShell (and then converted to executables) which let you change your Windows 10 system theme without needing to open any app for this.  

## Installation
1. Grab the latest release ZIP from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pratyakshm/Win10-Theme/releases) page.  
2. Extract the ZIP file and run Install.exe.  

## Usage
Open your Run dialog box (done by pressing Win key + R)  
To switch to:  
 **dark theme**, write ``dark`` and press ``Enter``.  
 **light theme**, write ``light`` and press ``Enter``.  

## Why this project?  
It is too tedious for me to switch themes in Windows 10, so I made this simple project to achieve that.  

## Antivirus conflicts
Some antivirus providers might detect this app as malware, and the only reason behind that is - it adds files into the C:\System32 directory. The project is open source for anyone to look at the code. Rest assured, this project is not infected with any sort of malware and the antivirus triggers can be treated as false positives.
