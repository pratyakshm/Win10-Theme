# Windows 10 - Theme Changer

## Description  
These are a simple set of scripts written in PowerShell (and then converted to executables) which let you change your Windows 10 system theme without needing to open any app for this.  

## Installation
1. Grab the latest release ZIP from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pratyakshm/Win10-Theme/releases) page.  
2. Extract the ZIP file and run Install.exe.  

## Usage
Open your Run dialog box (done by pressing Win key + R)  
To switch to:  
 **dark theme**, write ``dark`` and press ``Enter``.  
 **light theme**, write ``light`` and press ``Enter``.  

## Why this project?  
It is too tedious for me to switch themes in Windows 10, so I made this simple project to achieve that.
